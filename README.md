## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a user-friendly online portal for accessing current and forecasted weather information. I have developed an intuitive interface that allows users to search for cities and view detailed weather data effortlessly. By integrating weather APIs and implementing advanced search features, I aim to provide users with accurate and personalized weather forecasts. I am simplifying the process of accessing weather information and enhancing user experience.
